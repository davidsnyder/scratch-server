python3 server.py 
curl -X GET -v 127.0.0.1:9000

nc -l 9000
nc 127.0.0.1 9000

open two terminal windows and send data using netcat
use netcat to send files back and forth:
 Start by using nc to listen on a specific port, with output captured into a file:
           $ nc -l 1234 > filename.out
     Using a second machine, connect to the listening nc process, feeding it the file which is to be trans-
     ferred:
           $ nc host.example.com 1234 < filename.in

listen on a port using netcat and make a GET request in the browser, watch the request appear in the terminal
manually send back an HTML response, watch it appear in the browser

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 5

Hello

(can also send HTML tags, obviously)

nc google.com 80, send garbage and see the headers for the 400 Bad Request
nc google.com 80, make a head request "HEAD / HTTP/1.0" or GET request. You can manually make requests just like a browser would
 $ echo -n "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc host.example.com 80
If you get a 403 Forbidden, pass the Host in as part of the headers, eg: "Host: apple.com"

use ping to resolve the DNS of a website and get the IP address
 $ ping google.com
 build an email server from hand (port 25 for SMTP vs 80 for HTTP)

 nc -u -z hostname.com 1-100 (make a UDP connection to ports 1-100 on the server, will always succeed, but will show you the protocols)

 port vs. socket (socket = IP address + port)


 build a server from scratch, from always sending 200, to 404 and 400, to actually serving files
 GET parameters
 then be able to accept other requests: HEAD, POST
 connecting to a database and saving/retrieving records
 start with a flat file (tsv,csv) database and move to sqlite
 how to write SQL
 How can we style our pages using HTML/CSS/Javascript?
 What else can we do with sockets?



GET forms and POST forms
save a POST form and change the method type to "GET", see the parameters being passed explicitly
browsers/servers use cookies on the client to handle state
HTTP vs HTTPS

grab the form data from a website (using inspect) and try to login by dumping the headers (with the cookies) and passing them in manually
curl -v -d "authenticity_token=LTQfQB6MSU8LbRxfbHLrXqBy0py2Pv07dezrk6YRj58%3D&person%5Bemail_address%5D=dsnyder90%40gmail.com" --dump-headers headers 750words.com/auth/signin
curl -L -v -b headers 750words.com > 750words_logged_in.html ; open 750words_logged_in.html

What is an API?
echo '{"text": "Hello **world**!"}' | curl -d @- https://api.github.com/markdown

What is REST?


What is a blockchain? 
Can we make a cryptocurrency?
do the checksum work by hand
